## Fight for the glory of the great Toad One. Don't get eaten.

You are a mighty adventurer, sent to the temple of Bigfroggr the World Toad to fight your way into the depths. The greatest warriors congregate here, seeking to test their might against the undead which lurk within the temple. Whomever reaches the bottom shall have their name etched into the temple's walls; they are never seen again, presumed to have ascended to godhood.


## I'm sorry, what?
This is a game about fighting skeletons and stuff. It's a work in progress.

## Instructions:
Run main.py. When you start the game, you should see an empty room--empty except for a little guy in green armor. That's you.
Use the ARROW KEYS to move around. If you let go, you'll slide to a stop; press the opposite arrow key to stop faster.
Press the LEFT CONTROL KEY to shoot a burst of fire from your blade. Your weapon's POWER LEVEL is indicated by a blue bar at the bottom of the screen; as it depletes, your weapon will become less effective. Swords will be faster at high POWER LEVELs, axes become more deadly, and spears become more effective at long distances. Picking up a new weapon recharges your POWER.
Beware the ENEMIES, who always wear bloody RED colors. They will fire their own shots at you. You can avoid the incoming attacks, or--if you're cornered, or courageous--you can hit the incoming shots with your own shots to PARRY them.
