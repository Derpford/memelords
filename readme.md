## Fight for the glory of the great Toad One. Don't get eaten.

You are a mighty adventurer, sent to the temple of Bigfroggr the World Toad to fight your way into the depths. The greatest warriors congregate here, seeking to test their might against the undead which lurk within the temple. Whomever reaches the bottom shall have their name etched into the temple's walls; they are never seen again, presumed to have ascended to godhood.


## I'm sorry, what?
This is a game about fighting skeletons and stuff. It's a work in progress.
